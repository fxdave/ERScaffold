# Abstract

This thesis is about creating a code generator for web applications that are using relational database system for storing data and the whole application logic mirrors the structure of the database. This thesis is NOT about generating database scheme, this is about generating only application code, based on a model that is understandable enough to be able to show it to a customer, but also as powerful as a database logic model.
